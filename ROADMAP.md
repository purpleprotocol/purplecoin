    - [x] OP `0x00` Func - Start a function definition
    - [x] OP `0x01` BaseContext - Pushes to the top of the stack the base cryptographic context, which can be used to create application specific contexts by appending other contexts to it before being passed to cryptographic opcodes. The base context is specific to the current shard.
    - [x] OP `0x02` OpenImplicitCert - Pops a public key, transcript, context, and implicit certificate from the top of the stack and extracts the public key from the certificate.
    - [x] OP `0x03` OpenImplicitCertGlobal - Pops a public key, transcript, and an implicit certificate from the top of the stack and extracts the public key from the certificate. If successful, pushes the public key to the top of the stack. This receives the global context (network name) and is thus global. Public keys work on all shards. Use `OP_OpenImplicitCertScoped` for public keys which work only on a specific shard.
