# Technical Roadmap
This document presents the technical roadmap of the Purplecoin project. Please note that these are subject to change before the release. The roadmap branches off a higher level with subsections describing a greater level of detail.

## Purplecoin Core

* [ ] Consensus layer
  - [x] Implement sector blocks
  - [x] Implement shard blocks
  - [x] Implement RSA accumulators
  - [x] Optimise hashing to primes
  - [x] Use multiple accumulators per block
  - [x] Benchmark accumulator code in order to determine optimum number of sectors and shards
  - [x] Implement difficulty calculation
  - [x] Green PoW implementation
  - [x] Update RandomX to GhostRider
  - [x] Sequence PoW algorithms
  - [ ] Choose minimum mainnet difficulty
  - [x] Determine ASIC friendly hash functions
  - [x] Aggregate outputs with same spend script and receiver in the same block
  - [ ] Implement canonical transaction ordering
  - [ ] Implement partially spendable outputs
  - [x] Block serialization
  - [x] Transaction serialization
  - [x] Script arguments serialization
  - [ ] Headers MMR implementation
  - [ ] Find a way to dynamically determine the minimum fee for acceptance into the mempool
  - [ ] Find the optimal number of maximum suspends a transaction is allowed to have. With a limit on suspends, nodes can execute the whole chain of transactions and pre-validate them in order to determine if they will all execute whenever they receive a transaction which hits the `Suspend` opcode. By placing the correct upper bound on suspendable transactions, we can run long computations on the blockchain while also mitigating DDOS vectors in the mempool. The idea is that on the first transaction in a chain of these, the whole computation would be run up to either the number of suspends or the limit on suspends to validate the whole chain. Further transactions wouldn't require validating the whole chain as the VM state proves it was validated via a sequence number included in the vm state binary blob via consensus.
  - [ ] Implement suspendable transactions i.e. transactions that execute over several blocks.
  - [ ] Implement optimal atomic asset exchange script and use it as a default script
  * [ ] Implement VM opcodes
    - [x] OP `0x00` Func - Start a function definition
    - [ ] OP `0x05` Suspend - Suspends execution of the VM and creates an opaque output with the hash of the current execution state i.e. stack frame + input_stack + output_stack. This output can be re-spent to resume execution by anyone who includes it in a new transaction along with another input to pay the transaction fees. The VM must be started with special flags to resume the execution of the opaque output which must receive as arguments in the new transaction the following things: the original spending script, and the VM state binary blob.
