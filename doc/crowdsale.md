## Purplecoin Crowdsale
This document contains important information regarding the Purplecoin Crowdsale. For more information, please read the [Token Sale Agreement](https://purplecoin.io/tsa). To understand the scope of this project, take a look at the [Vision](https://github.com/purpleprotocol/purplecoin/blob/main/doc/vision.md) document.

### General information
* Start date 24 Jan 2023. The crowdsale ends on the 1st of August at 12pm GMT.
* Total coins for sale: 113,997,000 XPU (5% of the total supply before tail emission). 4.5% of the supply will be locked for 2 halving cycles. 0.5% will be used for contributor rewards, bounties or any endeavour of this sort. Check out the [Tokenomics Doc](https://github.com/purpleprotocol/purplecoin/blob/main/doc/tokenomics.md) as well.
* Sale rate: 1 ETH = 12000 XPU for first third of coins sold, 1 ETH = 8000 XPU for the next third, and 1 ETH = 4000 XPU for the last third. We frequently update the rate according to market fluctuations and according to current demand. Each purchase is settled at the current rate.
* All unsold XPU will be burnt.
* Individual cap: Max 500,000 XPU per person.
* Minimum buy: 0.05 ETH.
* Coins will not be liquid until the sale ends.
* Only coins sold in the crowdsale will be emitted in the smart contract. Developers will not be able to sell or access coins before the mainnet launch.
* Coins are transferred to the main chain by burning them on Ethereum and including the receiving Purplecoin address in the transaction.
* The sale is hosted at https://sale.purplecoin.io
* The Metamask browser extension is required to participate.

### How to participate
* First create a [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download/) wallet if you don't already have one. We also recommend using a [Hardware Wallet](https://shop.ledger.com/?referral_code=QP0E3G3B2Y90Q) to connect to Metamask. A hardware wallet stores your ETH and XPU in cold storage, removing risk of funds being stolen by malware.
* Transfer at least 0.01 ETH to your Metamask wallet.
* Visit https://sale.purplecoin.io and follow the instructions.
* Make sure to verify your identity after the initial purchase. You have 2 weeks to verify your identity. Further purchases do not require verification.
* Once the KYC verification is complete, you must wait for the sale to end.
* Once the sale has ended, you can generate a Purplecoin address and transfer your XPU to the main chain.

### I failed the KYC verification. Can I get a refund?
If you have failed the identity verification, you can request a refund from the sale website.

### What can I do with Purplecoins?
Purplecoins are used to pay the transactions fees when using the ledger for any purpose. They are the oil that powers the Purplecoin machine. As such, we should rather present what can be achieved with the Purplecoin platform. You can:
* File and then be able to authenticate any document publicly.
* Create any form of digital asset, representation of a real asset, or any form of digital representation of something that can be exchanged. Examples: Cryptocurrencies, FIAT currency representations, shareholders register, concert or venue tickets, the currency of a video game economy, NFTs or any other use-case that requires a tamper-proof ledger.
* Exchange any asset for any other asset that is built on top if the spending conditions on both assets allows it.
* Build and deploy scalable smart contracts that can be used by billions of users. Smart contracts in Purplecoin are asynchronous and have sharded state. One contract can achieve massive scale. Compilers can be written for languages such as C, C++ and Rust due to the ABI.

Any asset can also be used to pay transaction fees by exchanging it with Purplecoins in an atomic swap in the same transaction if there exists a liquidity provider for the pair.

### KYC Escrow
All funds are held in escrow in the crowdsale smart contract until a beneficiary's identity has been confirmed. The beneficiary is able to refund their purchase if their identity verification failed.

### Cold storage
Raised funds are kept in a 3 of 5 multi-sig setup with keys being stored at different compounds which we will not disclose the location or any other details of.

### Fund allocation
This is how we plan to allocate the raised funds:
* 50% will be used to fund the foundation responsible for governing post-launch. The usage of these funds will depend on the governing body of the foundation.
* 25% to pre-launch development/marketing/bounties/infrastructure.
* 25% kept in reserve for unforeseen circumstances such as legal expenses, unfavorable market fluctuations, or external catastrophic events. These funds will most probably be invested in other assets to hedge against ETH market volatility. They will flow to either the pre-launch pool or post-launch pool as needed.
