<p>If you think you have found a bug in the GMP library, please investigate it
and report it.  We have made this library available to you, and it is not too
much to ask you to report the bugs you find.
</p>
<p>Before you report a bug, check it&rsquo;s not already addressed in <a href="constant.Installing_GMP.html#Known-Build-Problems">Known Build Problems</a>, or perhaps <a href="constant.Installing_GMP.html#Notes-for-Particular-Systems">Notes for Particular Systems</a>.  You may also want
to check <a href="https://gmplib.org/">https://gmplib.org/</a> for patches for this release.
</p>
<p>Please include the following in any report,
</p>
<ul>
<li> The GMP version number, and if pre-packaged or patched then say so.
</li><li> A test program that makes it possible for us to reproduce the bug.  Include
instructions on how to run the program.
</li><li> A description of what is wrong.  If the results are incorrect, in what way.
If you get a crash, say so.
</li><li> If you get a crash, include a stack backtrace from the debugger if it&rsquo;s
informative (&lsquo;<samp>where</samp>&rsquo; in <code>gdb</code>, or &lsquo;<samp>$C</samp>&rsquo; in <code>adb</code>).
</li><li> Please do not send core dumps, executables or <code>strace</code>s.
</li><li> The &lsquo;<samp>configure</samp>&rsquo; options you used when building GMP, if any.
</li><li> The output from &lsquo;<samp>configure</samp>&rsquo;, as printed to stdout, with any options used.
</li><li> The name of the compiler and its version.  For <code>gcc</code>, get the version
with &lsquo;<samp>gcc -v</samp>&rsquo;, otherwise perhaps &lsquo;<samp>what `which cc`</samp>&rsquo;, or similar.
</li><li> The output from running &lsquo;<samp>uname -a</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li> The output from running &lsquo;<samp>./config.guess</samp>&rsquo;, and from running
&lsquo;<samp>./configfsf.guess</samp>&rsquo; (might be the same).
</li><li> If the bug is related to &lsquo;<samp>configure</samp>&rsquo;, then the compressed contents of
<samp>config.log</samp>.
</li><li> If the bug is related to an <samp>asm</samp> file not assembling, then the contents
of <samp>config.m4</samp> and the offending line or lines from the temporary
<samp>mpn/tmp-&lt;file&gt;.s</samp>.
</li></ul>
<p>Please make an effort to produce a self-contained report, with something
definite that can be tested or debugged.  Vague queries or piecemeal messages
are difficult to act on and don&rsquo;t help the development effort.
</p>
<p>It is not uncommon that an observed problem is actually due to a bug in the
compiler; the GMP code tends to explore interesting corners in compilers.
</p>
<p>If your bug report is good, we will do our best to help you get a corrected
version of the library; if the bug report is poor, we won&rsquo;t do anything about
it (except maybe ask you to send a better report).
</p>
<p>Send your report to: <a href="mailto:gmp-bugs@gmplib.org">gmp-bugs@gmplib.org</a>.
</p>
<p>If you think something in this manual is unclear, or downright incorrect, or if
the language needs to be improved, please send a note to the same address.
