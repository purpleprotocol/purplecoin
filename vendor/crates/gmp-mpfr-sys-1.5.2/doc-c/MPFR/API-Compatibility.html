<span id="API-Compatibility-1"></span><h2 class="chapter">6 API Compatibility</h2>
<p>The goal of this section is to describe some API changes that occurred
from one version of MPFR to another, and how to write code that can be compiled
and run with older MPFR versions.  The minimum MPFR version that is
considered here is 2.2.0 (released on 20 September 2005).
</p>
<p>API changes can only occur between major or minor versions.  Thus the
patchlevel (the third number in the MPFR version) will be ignored in
the following.  If a program does not use MPFR internals, changes in
the behavior between two versions differing only by the patchlevel
should only result from what was regarded as a bug or unspecified behavior.
</p>
<p>As a general rule, a program written for some MPFR version should work
with later versions, possibly except at a new major version, where
some features (described as obsolete for some time) can be removed.
In such a case, a failure should occur during compilation or linking.
If a result becomes incorrect because of such a change, please look
at the various changes below (they are minimal, and most software
should be unaffected), at the FAQ and at the MPFR web page for your
version (a bug could have been introduced and be already fixed);
and if the problem is not mentioned, please send us a bug report
(see <a href="constant.Reporting_Bugs.html#start">Reporting Bugs</a>).
</p>
<p>However, a program written for the current MPFR version (as documented
by this manual) may not necessarily work with previous versions of
MPFR.  This section should help developers to write portable code.
</p>
<p>Note: Information given here may be incomplete.  API changes are
also described in the NEWS file (for each version, instead of being
classified like here), together with other changes.

<span id="Type-and-Macro-Changes-1"></span><h3 class="section">6.1 Type and Macro Changes</h3>
<p>The official type for exponent values changed from <code>mp_exp_t</code> to
<code>mpfr_exp_t</code> in MPFR&nbsp;3.0.  The type <code>mp_exp_t</code> will remain
available as it comes from GMP (with a different meaning).  These types
are currently the same (<code>mpfr_exp_t</code> is defined as <code>mp_exp_t</code>
with <code>typedef</code>), so that programs can still use <code>mp_exp_t</code>;
but this may change in the future.
Alternatively, using the following code after including <samp>mpfr.h</samp>
will work with official MPFR versions, as <code>mpfr_exp_t</code> was never
defined in MPFR&nbsp;2.x:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">#if MPFR_VERSION_MAJOR &lt; 3
typedef mp_exp_t mpfr_exp_t;
#endif
</pre></div>
<p>The official types for precision values and for rounding modes
respectively changed from <code>mp_prec_t</code> and <code>mp_rnd_t</code>
to <code>mpfr_prec_t</code> and <code>mpfr_rnd_t</code> in MPFR&nbsp;3.0.  This
change was actually done a long time ago in MPFR, at least since
MPFR&nbsp;2.2.0, with the following code in <samp>mpfr.h</samp>:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">#ifndef mp_rnd_t
# define mp_rnd_t  mpfr_rnd_t
#endif
#ifndef mp_prec_t
# define mp_prec_t mpfr_prec_t
#endif
</pre></div>
<p>This means that it is safe to use the new official types
<code>mpfr_prec_t</code> and <code>mpfr_rnd_t</code> in your programs.
The types <code>mp_prec_t</code> and <code>mp_rnd_t</code> (defined
in MPFR only) may be removed in the future, as the prefix
<code>mp_</code> is reserved by GMP.
</p>
<p>The precision type <code>mpfr_prec_t</code> (<code>mp_prec_t</code>) was unsigned
before MPFR&nbsp;3.0; it is now signed.  <code>MPFR_PREC_MAX</code> has not
changed, though.  Indeed the MPFR code requires that <code>MPFR_PREC_MAX</code> be
representable in the exponent type, which may have the same size as
<code>mpfr_prec_t</code> but has always been signed.
The consequence is that valid code that does not assume anything about
the signedness of <code>mpfr_prec_t</code> should work with past and new MPFR
versions.
This change was useful as the use of unsigned types tends to convert
signed values to unsigned ones in expressions due to the usual arithmetic
conversions, which can yield incorrect results if a negative value is
converted in such a way.
Warning!  A program assuming (intentionally or not) that
<code>mpfr_prec_t</code> is signed may be affected by this problem when
it is built and run against MPFR&nbsp;2.x.
</p>
<p>The rounding modes <code>GMP_RNDx</code> were renamed to <code>MPFR_RNDx</code>
in MPFR&nbsp;3.0. However, the old names <code>GMP_RNDx</code> have been kept for
compatibility (this might change in future versions), using:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">#define GMP_RNDN MPFR_RNDN
#define GMP_RNDZ MPFR_RNDZ
#define GMP_RNDU MPFR_RNDU
#define GMP_RNDD MPFR_RNDD
</pre></div>
<p>The rounding mode &ldquo;round away from zero&rdquo; (<code>MPFR_RNDA</code>) was added in
MPFR&nbsp;3.0 (however, no rounding mode <code>GMP_RNDA</code> exists).
Faithful rounding (<code>MPFR_RNDF</code>) was added in MPFR&nbsp;4.0, but
currently, it is partially supported.
</p>
<p>The flags-related macros, whose name starts with <code>MPFR_FLAGS_</code>,
were added in MPFR&nbsp;4.0 (for the new functions <code>mpfr_flags_clear</code>,
<code>mpfr_flags_restore</code>, <code>mpfr_flags_set</code> and <code>mpfr_flags_test</code>,
in particular).

<span id="Added-Functions-1"></span><h3 class="section">6.2 Added Functions</h3>
<p>We give here in alphabetical order the functions (and function-like macros)

Note: MPFR&nbsp;2.2 had a <code>mpfr_copysign</code> function that was available,

macro in <samp>mpfr.h</samp>:
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#define mpfr_custom_get_mantissa mpfr_custom_get_significand

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#define mpfr_get_z_exp mpfr_get_z_2exp
</pre></div>
<p>Thus code that needs to work with both MPFR&nbsp;2.x and MPFR&nbsp;3.x should
use <code>mpfr_get_z_exp</code>.

<span id="Changed-Functions-1"></span><h3 class="section">6.3 Changed Functions</h3>
<p>The following functions and function-like macros have changed after
MPFR&nbsp;2.2. Changes can affect the behavior of code written for
some MPFR version when built and run against another MPFR version
(older or newer), as described below.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The formatted output functions (<code>mpfr_printf</code>, etc.) have
slightly changed in MPFR&nbsp;4.1 in the case where the precision field
is empty: trailing zeros were not output with the conversion specifier
&lsquo;<samp>e</samp>&rsquo; / &lsquo;<samp>E</samp>&rsquo; (the chosen precision was not fully specified and
it depended on the input value), and also on the value zero with the
conversion specifiers &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; / &lsquo;<samp>F</samp>&rsquo; / &lsquo;<samp>g</samp>&rsquo; / &lsquo;<samp>G</samp>&rsquo; (this
could partly be regarded as a bug); they are now kept in a way similar
to the formatted output functions from C. Moreover, the case where the
precision consists only of a period has been fixed in MPFR&nbsp;4.2 to
be like &lsquo;<samp>.0</samp>&rsquo; as specified in the ISO C standard (it previously
behaved as a missing precision).
</li><li> <code>mpfr_abs</code>, <code>mpfr_neg</code> and <code>mpfr_set</code> changed in
MPFR&nbsp;4.0.
In previous MPFR versions, the sign bit of a NaN was unspecified; however,
in practice, it was set as now specified except for <code>mpfr_neg</code> with
a reused argument: <code>mpfr_neg(x,x,rnd)</code>.
</li><li> <code>mpfr_check_range</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;2.3.2 and MPFR&nbsp;2.4.
If the value is an inexact infinity, the overflow flag is now set
(in case it was lost), while it was previously left unchanged.
This is really what is expected in practice (and what the MPFR code
was expecting), so that the previous behavior was regarded as a bug.
Hence the change in MPFR&nbsp;2.3.2.
</li><li> <code>mpfr_eint</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;4.0.
This function now returns the value of the E1/eint1 function for
negative argument (before MPFR&nbsp;4.0, it was returning NaN).
</li><li> <code>mpfr_get_f</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;3.0.
This function was returning zero, except for NaN and Inf, which do not
exist in MPF. The <em>erange</em> flag is now set in these cases,
and <code>mpfr_get_f</code> now returns the usual ternary value.
</li><li> <code>mpfr_get_si</code>, <code>mpfr_get_sj</code>, <code>mpfr_get_ui</code>
and <code>mpfr_get_uj</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;3.0.
In previous MPFR versions, the cases where the <em>erange</em> flag
is set were unspecified.
</li><li> <code>mpfr_get_str</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;4.0.
This function now sets the NaN flag on NaN input (to follow the usual MPFR
rules on NaN and IEEE&nbsp;754 recommendations on string conversions
from Subclause&nbsp;5.12.1) and sets the inexact flag when the conversion
is inexact.
</li><li> <code>mpfr_get_z</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;3.0.
The return type was <code>void</code>; it is now <code>int</code>, and the usual
ternary value is returned.  Thus programs that need to work with both
MPFR&nbsp;2.x and 3.x must not use the return value.  Even in this case,
C code using <code>mpfr_get_z</code> as the second or third term of
a conditional operator may also be affected. For instance, the
following is correct with MPFR&nbsp;3.0, but not with MPFR&nbsp;2.x:
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">bool ? mpfr_get_z(...) : mpfr_add(...);
</pre></div>
<p>On the other hand, the following is correct with MPFR&nbsp;2.x, but not
with MPFR&nbsp;3.0:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">bool ? mpfr_get_z(...) : (void) mpfr_add(...);
</pre></div>
<p>Portable code should cast <code>mpfr_get_z(...)</code> to <code>void</code> to
use the type <code>void</code> for both terms of the conditional operator,
as in:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">bool ? (void) mpfr_get_z(...) : (void) mpfr_add(...);
</pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, <code>if ... else</code> can be used instead of the
conditional operator.
</p>
<p>Moreover the cases where the <em>erange</em> flag is set were unspecified
in MPFR&nbsp;2.x.
</p>
</li><li> <code>mpfr_get_z_exp</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;3.0.
In previous MPFR versions, the cases where the <em>erange</em> flag
is set were unspecified.
Note: this function has been renamed to <code>mpfr_get_z_2exp</code>
in MPFR&nbsp;3.0, but <code>mpfr_get_z_exp</code> is still available for
compatibility reasons.
</li><li> <code>mpfr_out_str</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;4.1.
The argument <var>base</var> can now be negative (from -2 to
-36), in order to follow <code>mpfr_get_str</code> and GMP&rsquo;s
<code>mpf_out_str</code> functions.
</li><li> <code>mpfr_set_exp</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;4.0.
Before MPFR&nbsp;4.0, the exponent was set whatever the contents of the MPFR
object in argument. In practice, this could be useful as a low-level
function when the MPFR number was being constructed by setting the fields
of its internal structure, but the API does not provide a way to do this
except by using internals. Thus, for the API, this behavior was useless
and could quickly lead to undefined behavior due to the fact that the
generated value could have an invalid format if the MPFR object contained
a special value (NaN, infinity or zero).
</li><li> <code>mpfr_strtofr</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;2.3.1 and MPFR&nbsp;2.4.
This was actually a bug fix since the code and the documentation did
not match.  But both were changed in order to have a more consistent
and useful behavior.  The main changes in the code are as follows.
The binary exponent is now accepted even without the &lsquo;<samp>0b</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp>0x</samp>&rsquo; prefix.  Data corresponding to NaN can now have an optional
sign (such data were previously invalid).
</li><li> <code>mpfr_strtofr</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;3.0.
This function now accepts bases from 37 to 62 (no changes for the other
bases).  Note: if an unsupported base is provided to this function,
the behavior is undefined; more precisely, in MPFR&nbsp;2.3.1 and later,
providing an unsupported base yields an assertion failure (this
behavior may change in the future).
</li><li> <code>mpfr_subnormalize</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;3.1.
This was actually regarded as a bug fix. The <code>mpfr_subnormalize</code>
implementation up to MPFR&nbsp;3.0.0 did not change the flags. In particular,
it did not follow the generic rule concerning the inexact flag (and no
special behavior was specified). The case of the underflow flag was more
a lack of specification.
</li><li> <code>mpfr_sum</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;4.0.
The <code>mpfr_sum</code> function has completely been rewritten for MPFR&nbsp;4.0,
with an update of the specification: the sign of an exact zero result
is now specified, and the return value is now the usual ternary value.
The old <code>mpfr_sum</code> implementation could also take all the memory
and crash on inputs of very different magnitude.
</li><li> <code>mpfr_urandom</code> and <code>mpfr_urandomb</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;3.1.
Their behavior no longer depends on the platform (assuming this is also true
for GMP&rsquo;s random generator, which is not the case between GMP 4.1 and 4.2 if
<code>gmp_randinit_default</code> is used).  As a consequence, the returned values
can be different between MPFR&nbsp;3.1 and previous MPFR versions.
Note: as the reproducibility of these functions was not specified
before MPFR&nbsp;3.1, the MPFR&nbsp;3.1 behavior is <em>not</em> regarded as
backward incompatible with previous versions.
</li><li> <code>mpfr_urandom</code> changed in MPFR&nbsp;4.0.
The next random state no longer depends on the current exponent range and
the rounding mode. The exceptions due to the rounding of the random number
are now correctly generated, following the uniform distribution.
As a consequence, the returned values can be different between MPFR&nbsp;4.0
and previous MPFR versions.
</li><li> Up to MPFR&nbsp;4.1.0, some macros of the <a href="constant.MPFR_Interface.html#Custom-Interface">Custom Interface</a> had
undocumented limitations. In particular, their arguments may be evaluated
multiple times or none.

<p>Functions <code>mpfr_random</code> and <code>mpfr_random2</code> have been

MPFR&nbsp;3.0 or later).
(The function <code>mpfr_random</code> had been deprecated since at least
MPFR&nbsp;2.2.0, and <code>mpfr_random2</code> since MPFR&nbsp;2.4.0.)
</p>
<p>Macros <code>mpfr_add_one_ulp</code> and <code>mpfr_sub_one_ulp</code> have been
removed in MPFR&nbsp;4.0. They were no longer documented since
MPFR&nbsp;2.1.0 and were announced as deprecated since MPFR&nbsp;3.1.0.
</p>
<p>Function <code>mpfr_grandom</code> is marked as deprecated in MPFR&nbsp;4.0.
It will be removed in a future release.

<p>For users of a C++ compiler, the way how the availability of <code>intmax_t</code>
is detected has changed in MPFR&nbsp;3.0.
In MPFR&nbsp;2.x, if a macro <code>INTMAX_C</code> or <code>UINTMAX_C</code> was defined
(e.g. when the <code>__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS</code> macro had been defined
before <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</code> has been included),
<code>intmax_t</code> was assumed to be defined.
However, this was not always the case (more precisely, <code>intmax_t</code>
can be defined only in the namespace <code>std</code>, as with Boost), so
that compilations could fail.
Thus the check for <code>INTMAX_C</code> or <code>UINTMAX_C</code> is now disabled for
C++ compilers, with the following consequences:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Programs written for MPFR&nbsp;2.x that need <code>intmax_t</code> may no
longer be compiled against MPFR&nbsp;3.0: a <code>#define MPFR_USE_INTMAX_T</code>
may be necessary before <samp>mpfr.h</samp> is included.
</li><li> The compilation of programs that work with MPFR&nbsp;3.0 may fail with
MPFR&nbsp;2.x due to the problem described above.  Workarounds are possible,
such as defining <code>intmax_t</code> and <code>uintmax_t</code> in the global
namespace, though this is not clean.
</li></ul>
<p>The divide-by-zero exception is new in MPFR&nbsp;3.1. However, it should
not introduce incompatible changes for programs that strictly follow
the MPFR API since the exception can only be seen via new functions.
</p>
<p>As of MPFR&nbsp;3.1, the <samp>mpfr.h</samp> header can be included several times,
while still supporting optional functions (see <a href="constant.MPFR_Basics.html#Headers-and-Libraries">Headers and Libraries</a>).
</p>
<p>The way memory is allocated by MPFR should be regarded as well-specified
only as of MPFR&nbsp;4.0.
