<p>The main developers of MPFR are Guillaume Hanrot, Vincent Lef&egrave;vre,
Patrick P&eacute;lissier, Philippe Th&eacute;veny and Paul Zimmermann.
</p>
<p>Sylvie Boldo from ENS-Lyon, France,
contributed the functions <code>mpfr_agm</code> and <code>mpfr_log</code>.
Sylvain Chevillard contributed the <code>mpfr_ai</code> function.
David Daney contributed the hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions,
the base-2 exponential, and the factorial function.
Alain Delplanque contributed the new version of the <code>mpfr_get_str</code>
function.
Mathieu Dutour contributed the functions <code>mpfr_acos</code>, <code>mpfr_asin</code>
and <code>mpfr_atan</code>, and a previous version of <code>mpfr_gamma</code>.
Laurent Fousse contributed the original version of the <code>mpfr_sum</code>
function (used up to MPFR&nbsp;3.1).
Emmanuel Jeandel, from ENS-Lyon too,
contributed the generic hypergeometric code,
as well as the internal function <code>mpfr_exp3</code>,
a first implementation of the sine and cosine,
and improved versions of
<code>mpfr_const_log2</code> and <code>mpfr_const_pi</code>.
Ludovic Meunier helped in the design of the <code>mpfr_erf</code> code.
Jean-Luc R&eacute;my contributed the <code>mpfr_zeta</code> code.
Fabrice Rouillier contributed the <code>mpfr_xxx_z</code> and <code>mpfr_xxx_q</code>
functions, and helped to the Microsoft Windows porting.
Damien Stehl&eacute; contributed the <code>mpfr_get_ld_2exp</code> function.
Charles Karney contributed the <code>mpfr_nrandom</code> and <code>mpfr_erandom</code>
functions.
</p>
<p>We would like to thank Jean-Michel Muller and Joris van der Hoeven for very
fruitful discussions at the beginning of that project, Torbj&ouml;rn Granlund
and Kevin Ryde for their help about design issues,
and Nathalie Revol for her careful reading of a previous version of
this documentation. In particular
Kevin Ryde did a tremendous job for the portability of MPFR in 2002-2004.
</p>
<p>The development of the MPFR library would not have been possible without
the continuous support of INRIA, and of the LORIA (Nancy, France) and LIP
(Lyon, France) laboratories. In particular the main authors were or are
members of the PolKA, Spaces, Cacao, Caramel and Caramba
project-teams at LORIA and of the
Ar&eacute;naire and AriC project-teams at LIP.
This project was started during the Fiable (reliable in French) action
supported by INRIA, and continued during the AOC action.
The development of MPFR was also supported by a grant
(202F0659 00 MPN 121) from the Conseil R&eacute;gional de Lorraine in 2002,
from INRIA by an &quot;associate engineer&quot; grant (2003-2005),
an &quot;op&eacute;ration de d&eacute;veloppement logiciel&quot; grant (2007-2009),
and the post-doctoral grant of Sylvain Chevillard in 2009-2010.
The MPFR-MPC workshop in June 2012 was partly supported by the ERC
grant ANTICS of Andreas Enge.
The MPFR-MPC workshop in January 2013 was partly supported by the ERC
grant ANTICS, the GDR IM and the Caramel project-team, during which
MickaÃ«l Gastineau contributed the MPFRbench program,
Fredrik Johansson a faster version of <code>mpfr_const_euler</code>,
and Jianyang Pan a formally proven version of the <code>mpfr_add1sp1</code>
internal routine.
