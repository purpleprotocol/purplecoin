<span id="MPFR-and-the-IEEE-754-Standard-1"></span><h2 class="chapter">7 MPFR and the IEEE 754 Standard</h2>
<p>This section describes differences between MPFR and the IEEE&nbsp;754
standard, and behaviors that are not specified yet in IEEE&nbsp;754.
</p>
<p>The MPFR numbers do not include subnormals. The reason is that subnormals
are less useful than in IEEE&nbsp;754 as the default exponent range in MPFR
is large and they would have made the implementation more complex.
However, subnormals can be emulated using <code>mpfr_subnormalize</code>.
</p>
<p>MPFR has a single NaN. The behavior is similar either to a signaling NaN or
to a quiet NaN, depending on the context. For any function returning a NaN
(either produced or propagated), the NaN flag is set, while in IEEE&nbsp;754,
some operations are quiet (even on a signaling NaN).
</p>
<p>The <code>mpfr_rec_sqrt</code> function differs from IEEE&nbsp;754 on -0,
where it gives +Inf (like for +0), following the usual limit rules,
instead of -Inf.
</p>
<p>The <code>mpfr_root</code> function predates IEEE&nbsp;754-2008, where rootn was
introduced, and behaves differently from the IEEE&nbsp;754 rootn operation.
It is deprecated and <code>mpfr_rootn_ui</code> should be used instead.
</p>
<p>Operations with an unsigned zero: For functions taking an argument of
integer or rational type, a zero of such a type is unsigned unlike the
floating-point zero (this includes the zero of type <code>unsigned long</code>,
which is a mathematical, exact zero, as opposed to a floating-point zero,
which may come from an underflow and whose sign would correspond to the
sign of the real non-zero value). Unless documented otherwise, this zero
is regarded as +0, as if it were first converted to a MPFR number with
<code>mpfr_set_ui</code> or <code>mpfr_set_si</code> (thus the result may not agree
with the usual limit rules applied to a mathematical zero). This is not
the case of addition and subtraction (<code>mpfr_add_ui</code>, etc.), but for
these functions, only the sign of a zero result would be affected, with
+0 and -0 considered equal.
Such operations are currently out of the scope of the IEEE&nbsp;754 standard,
and at the time of specification in MPFR, the Floating-Point Working Group
in charge of the revision of IEEE&nbsp;754 did not want to discuss issues with
non-floating-point types in general.
</p>
<p>Note also that some obvious differences may come from the fact that in
MPFR, each variable has its own precision. For instance, a subtraction
of two numbers of the same sign may yield an overflow; idem for a call
to <code>mpfr_set</code>, <code>mpfr_neg</code> or <code>mpfr_abs</code>, if the destination
variable has a smaller precision.
