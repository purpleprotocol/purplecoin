# Future compatibility

The fields listed here are considered internal details. These internals may
change in new minor releases of this crate, though they will be kept unchanged
for patch releases. Any code that makes use of these internals should list the
dependency as `version = "~1.5"` inside [*Cargo.toml*], *not* `version = "1.5"`.
