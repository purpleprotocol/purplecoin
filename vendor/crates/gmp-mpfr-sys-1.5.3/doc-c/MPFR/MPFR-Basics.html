<h3 class="section" id="Headers-and-Libraries-1">4.1 Headers and Libraries</h3>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_002eh"></a>
<p>All declarations needed to use MPFR are collected in the include file
<samp class="file">mpfr.h</samp>.  It is designed to work with both C and C++ compilers.
You should include that file in any program using the MPFR library:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">#include &lt;mpfr.h&gt;
</pre></div>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-stdio_002eh"></a>
<p>Note, however, that prototypes for MPFR functions with <code class="code">FILE *</code> parameters
are provided only if <code class="code">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> is included too (before <samp class="file">mpfr.h</samp>):
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;mpfr.h&gt;
</pre></div>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-stdarg_002eh"></a>
<p>Likewise <code class="code">&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</code> (or <code class="code">&lt;varargs.h&gt;</code>) is required for prototypes
with <code class="code">va_list</code> parameters, such as <code class="code">mpfr_vprintf</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-stdint_002eh"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-inttypes_002eh"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-intmax_005ft"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-uintmax_005ft"></a>
<p>And for any functions using <code class="code">intmax_t</code>, you must include
<code class="code">&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> or <code class="code">&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</code> before <samp class="file">mpfr.h</samp>, to
allow <samp class="file">mpfr.h</samp> to define prototypes for these functions.
Moreover, under some platforms (in particular with C++ compilers),
users may need to define
<code class="code">MPFR_USE_INTMAX_T</code> (and should do it for portability) before
<samp class="file">mpfr.h</samp> has been included; of course, it is possible to do that
on the command line, e.g., with <code class="code">-DMPFR_USE_INTMAX_T</code>.
</p>
<p>Note: If <samp class="file">mpfr.h</samp> and/or <samp class="file">gmp.h</samp> (used by <samp class="file">mpfr.h</samp>)
are included several times (possibly from another header file),
<code class="code">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> and/or <code class="code">&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</code> (or <code class="code">&lt;varargs.h&gt;</code>)
should be included <strong class="strong">before the first inclusion</strong> of
<samp class="file">mpfr.h</samp> or <samp class="file">gmp.h</samp>.  Alternatively, you can define
<code class="code">MPFR_USE_FILE</code> (for MPFR I/O functions) and/or
<code class="code">MPFR_USE_VA_LIST</code> (for MPFR functions with <code class="code">va_list</code>
parameters) anywhere before the last inclusion of <samp class="file">mpfr.h</samp>.
As a consequence, if your file is a public header that includes
<samp class="file">mpfr.h</samp>, you need to use the latter method.
</p>
<p>When calling a MPFR macro, it is not allowed to have previously defined
a macro with the same name as some keywords (currently <code class="code">do</code>,
<code class="code">while</code> and <code class="code">sizeof</code>).
</p>
<p>You can avoid the use of MPFR macros encapsulating functions by defining
the <code class="code">MPFR_USE_NO_MACRO</code> macro before <samp class="file">mpfr.h</samp> is included.  In
general this should not be necessary, but this can be useful when debugging
user code: with some macros, the compiler may emit spurious warnings with
some warning options, and macros can prevent some prototype checking.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Libraries"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Linking"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-libmpfr"></a>
<p>All programs using MPFR must link against both <samp class="file">libmpfr</samp> and
<samp class="file">libgmp</samp> libraries.  On a typical Unix-like system this can be
done with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-lmpfr -lgmp</samp>&rsquo; (in that order), for example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">gcc myprogram.c -lmpfr -lgmp
</pre></div>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Libtool"></a>
<p>MPFR is built using Libtool and an application can use that to link if
desired, see <cite class="cite">GNU Libtool</cite>.
</p>
<p>If MPFR has been installed to a non-standard location, then it may be
necessary to set up environment variables such as &lsquo;<samp class="samp">C_INCLUDE_PATH</samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">LIBRARY_PATH</samp>&rsquo;, or use &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-I</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-L</samp>&rsquo; compiler options,
in order to point to the right directories. For a shared library, it may
also be necessary to set up some sort of run-time library path (e.g.,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</samp>&rsquo;) on some systems. Please read the <samp class="file">INSTALL</samp>
file for additional information.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible to use &lsquo;<samp class="samp">pkg-config</samp>&rsquo; (a file
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">mpfr.pc</samp>&rsquo; is provided as of MPFR&nbsp;4.0):
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">cc myprogram.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs mpfr)
</pre></div>
<p>Note that the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">MPFR_</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">mpfr_</samp>&rsquo; prefixes are reserved for MPFR.
As a general rule, in order to avoid clashes, software using MPFR (directly
or indirectly) and system headers/libraries should not define macros and
symbols using these prefixes.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Regular-number"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_005ft"></a>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_005fsrcptr"></a>
<p>A <em class="dfn">floating-point number</em>, or <em class="dfn">float</em> for short, is an object
representing a radix-2 floating-point number consisting of a sign,
an arbitrary-precision normalized significand (also called mantissa),
and an exponent (an integer in some given range); these are called
<em class="dfn">regular numbers</em>. By convention, the radix point of the significand
is just before the first digit (which is always 1 due to normalization),
like in the C language, but unlike in IEEE&nbsp;754 (thus, for a given
number, the exponent values in MPFR and in IEEE&nbsp;754 differ by 1).
</p>
<p>Like in the IEEE&nbsp;754 standard, a floating-point number can also
have three kinds of special values: a signed zero (+0 or &minus;0),
a signed infinity (+Inf or &minus;Inf), and Not-a-Number (NaN). NaN
can represent the default value of a floating-point object and the
result of some operations for which no other results would make sense,
such as 0 divided by 0 or +Inf minus +Inf; unless
documented otherwise, the sign bit of a NaN is unspecified.
Note that contrary to IEEE&nbsp;754, MPFR has a single kind of NaN and
does not have subnormals.
Other than that, the behavior is very similar to IEEE&nbsp;754, but there
are some minor differences.
</p>
<p>The C data type for such objects is <code class="code">mpfr_t</code>, internally defined
as a one-element array of a structure (so that when passed as an
argument to a function, it is the pointer that is actually passed),
and <code class="code">mpfr_ptr</code> is the C data type representing a pointer to this
structure; <code class="code">mpfr_srcptr</code> is like <code class="code">mpfr_ptr</code>, but the structure
is read-only (i.e., const qualified).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Precision"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_005fprec_005ft"></a>
<p>The <em class="dfn">precision</em> is the number of bits used to represent the significand
of a floating-point number;
the corresponding C data type is <code class="code">mpfr_prec_t</code>.
The precision can be any integer between <code class="code">MPFR_PREC_MIN</code> and
<code class="code">MPFR_PREC_MAX</code>. In the current implementation, <code class="code">MPFR_PREC_MIN</code>
is equal to 1.
</p>
<p>Warning! MPFR needs to increase the precision internally, in order to
provide accurate results (and in particular, correct rounding). Do not
attempt to set the precision to any value near <code class="code">MPFR_PREC_MAX</code>,
otherwise MPFR will abort due to an assertion failure. However, in practice,
the real limitation will probably be the available memory on your platform,
and in case of lack of memory, the program may abort, crash or have
undefined behavior (depending on your C implementation).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Exponent"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_005fexp_005ft"></a>
<p>An <em class="dfn">exponent</em> is a component of a regular floating-point number.
Its C data type is <code class="code">mpfr_exp_t</code>. Valid exponents are restricted
to a subset of this type, and the exponent range can be changed globally
as described in <a class="ref" href="constant.MPFR_Interface.html#Exception-Related-Functions">Exception Related Functions</a>. Special values do not
have an exponent.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Rounding"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_005frnd_005ft"></a>
<p>The <em class="dfn">rounding mode</em> specifies the way to round the result of a
floating-point operation, in case the exact result cannot be represented
exactly in the destination (see <a class="pxref" href="#Rounding">Rounding</a>).
The corresponding C data type is <code class="code">mpfr_rnd_t</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Group-of-flags"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mpfr_005fflags_005ft"></a>
<p>MPFR has a global (or per-thread) flag for each supported exception and
provides operations on flags (<a class="ref" href="#Exceptions">Exceptions</a>). This C data type is used
to represent a group of flags (or a mask).

<h3 class="section" id="MPFR-Variable-Conventions-1">4.3 MPFR Variable Conventions</h3>
<p>Before you can assign to a MPFR variable, you need to initialize it by calling
one of the special initialization functions.  When you are done with a
variable, you need to clear it out, using one of the functions for that
purpose.
A variable should only be initialized once, or at least cleared out between
each initialization.  After a variable has been initialized, it may be
assigned to any number of times.
For efficiency reasons, avoid to initialize and clear out a variable in loops.
Instead, initialize it before entering the loop, and clear it out after the
loop has exited.
You do not need to be concerned about allocating additional space for MPFR
variables, since any variable has a significand of fixed size.
Hence unless you change its precision, or clear and reinitialize it,
a floating-point variable will have the same allocated space during all its
life.
</p>
<p>As a general rule, all MPFR functions expect output arguments before input
arguments.  This notation is based on an analogy with the assignment operator.
MPFR allows you to use the same variable for both input and output in the same
expression.  For example, the main function for floating-point multiplication,
<code class="code">mpfr_mul</code>, can be used like this: <code class="code">mpfr_mul (x, x, x, rnd)</code>.
This computes the square of <var class="var">x</var> with rounding mode <code class="code">rnd</code>
and puts the result back in <var class="var">x</var>.

<h3 class="section" id="Rounding-1">4.4 Rounding</h3>
<p>The following rounding modes are supported:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li><code class="code">MPFR_RNDN</code>: round to nearest, with the even rounding rule
      (roundTiesToEven in IEEE&nbsp;754); see details below.
</li><li><code class="code">MPFR_RNDD</code>: round toward negative infinity
      (roundTowardNegative in IEEE&nbsp;754).
</li><li><code class="code">MPFR_RNDU</code>: round toward positive infinity
      (roundTowardPositive in IEEE&nbsp;754).
</li><li><code class="code">MPFR_RNDZ</code>: round toward zero
      (roundTowardZero in IEEE&nbsp;754).
</li><li><code class="code">MPFR_RNDA</code>: round away from zero.
</li><li><code class="code">MPFR_RNDF</code>: faithful rounding. This feature is currently
experimental. Specific support for this rounding mode has been added
to some functions, such as the basic operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, square, division, square root) or when explicitly
documented. It might also work with other functions, as it is possible that
they do not need modification in their code; even though a correct behavior
is not guaranteed yet (corrections were done when failures occurred in the
test suite, but almost nothing has been checked manually), failures should
be regarded as bugs and reported, so that they can be fixed.
</li></ul>
<p>Note that, in particular for a result equal to zero, the sign is preserved
by the rounding operation.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">MPFR_RNDN</code> mode works like roundTiesToEven from the
IEEE&nbsp;754 standard: in case the number to be rounded lies exactly
in the middle between two consecutive representable numbers, it is
rounded to the one with an even significand; in radix 2, this means
that the least significant bit is 0. For example, the number 2.5,
which is represented by (10.1) in binary, is rounded to (10.0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<!-- /@w -->
with a precision of two bits, and not to (11.0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;3<!-- /@w -->.
This rule avoids the <em class="dfn">drift</em> phenomenon mentioned by Knuth in volume 2
of The Art of Computer Programming (Section&nbsp;4.2.2).
</p>
<p>Note: In particular for a 1-digit precision (in radix 2 or other radices,
as in conversions to a string of digits), one considers the significands
associated with the exponent of the number to be rounded. For instance,
to round the number 95 in radix 10 with a 1-digit precision, one considers
its truncated 1-digit integer significand 9 and the following integer 10
(since these are consecutive integers, exactly one of them is even).
10 is the even significand, so that 95 will be rounded to 100, not to 90.
</p>
<p>For the <em class="dfn">directed rounding modes</em>, a number <var class="var">x</var> is rounded to
the number <var class="var">y</var> that is the closest to <var class="var">x</var> such that
</p><ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li><code class="code">MPFR_RNDD</code>:
      <var class="var">y</var> is less than or equal to <var class="var">x</var>;
</li><li><code class="code">MPFR_RNDU</code>:
      <var class="var">y</var> is greater than or equal to <var class="var">x</var>;
</li><li><code class="code">MPFR_RNDZ</code>:
      abs(<var class="var">y</var>) is less than or equal to abs(<var class="var">x</var>);
</li><li><code class="code">MPFR_RNDA</code>:
      abs(<var class="var">y</var>) is greater than or equal to abs(<var class="var">x</var>).
</li></ul>
<p>The <code class="code">MPFR_RNDF</code> mode works as follows: the computed value is either
that corresponding to <code class="code">MPFR_RNDD</code> or that corresponding to
<code class="code">MPFR_RNDU</code>.
In particular when those values are identical,
i.e., when the result of the corresponding operation is exactly
representable, that exact result is returned.
Thus, the computed result can take at most two possible values, and
in absence of underflow/overflow, the corresponding error is strictly
less than one ulp (unit in the last place) of that result and of the
exact result.
For <code class="code">MPFR_RNDF</code>, the ternary value (defined below) and the inexact flag
(defined later, as with the other flags) are unspecified, the divide-by-zero
flag is as with other roundings, and the underflow and overflow flags match
what would be obtained in the case the computed value is the same as with
<code class="code">MPFR_RNDD</code> or <code class="code">MPFR_RNDU</code>.
The results may not be reproducible.
</p>
<a class="anchor" id="ternary-value"></a><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Ternary-value"></a>
<p>Most MPFR functions take as first argument the destination variable, as
second and following arguments the input variables, as last argument a
rounding mode, and have a return value of type <code class="code">int</code>, called the
<em class="dfn">ternary value</em>. The value stored in the destination variable is
correctly rounded, i.e., MPFR behaves as if it computed the result with
an infinite precision, then rounded it to the precision of this variable.
The input variables are regarded as exact (in particular, their precision
does not affect the result).
</p>
<p>As a consequence, in case of a non-zero real rounded result, the error
on the result is less than or equal to 1/2 ulp (unit in the last place) of
that result in the rounding to nearest mode, and less than 1 ulp of that
result in the directed rounding modes (a ulp is the weight of the least
significant represented bit of the result after rounding).
</p>
<p>Unless documented otherwise, functions returning an <code class="code">int</code> return
a ternary value.
If the ternary value is zero, it means that the value stored in the
destination variable is the exact result of the corresponding mathematical
function. If the ternary value is positive (resp. negative), it means
the value stored in the destination variable is greater (resp. lower)
than the exact result. For example with the <code class="code">MPFR_RNDU</code> rounding mode,
the ternary value is usually positive, except when the result is exact, in
which case it is zero. In the case of an infinite result, it is considered
as inexact when it was obtained by overflow, and exact otherwise. A NaN
result (Not-a-Number) always corresponds to an exact return value.
The opposite of a returned ternary value is guaranteed to be representable
in an <code class="code">int</code>.
</p>
<p>Unless documented otherwise, functions returning as result the value <code class="code">1</code>
(or any other value specified in this manual)
for special cases (like <code class="code">acos(0)</code>) yield an overflow or
an underflow if that value is not representable in the current exponent range.

</div>
<h3 class="section" id="Floating_002dPoint-Values-on-Special-Numbers-1">4.5 Floating-Point Values on Special Numbers</h3>
<p>This section specifies the floating-point values (of type <code class="code">mpfr_t</code>)
returned by MPFR functions (where by &ldquo;returned&rdquo; we mean here the modified
value of the destination object, which should not be mixed with the ternary
return value of type <code class="code">int</code> of those functions).
For functions returning several values (like
<code class="code">mpfr_sin_cos</code>), the rules apply to each result separately.
</p>
<p>Functions can have one or several input arguments. An input point is
a mapping from these input arguments to the set of the MPFR numbers.
When none of its components are NaN, an input point can also be seen
as a tuple in the extended real numbers (the set of the real numbers
with both infinities).
</p>
<p>When the input point is in the domain of the mathematical function, the
result is rounded as described in <a class="ref" href="#Rounding">Rounding</a> (but see
below for the specification of the sign of an exact zero). Otherwise
the general rules from this section apply unless stated otherwise in
the description of the MPFR function (<a class="ref" href="constant.MPFR_Interface.html#MPFR-Interface">MPFR Interface</a>).
</p>
<p>When the input point is not in the domain of the mathematical function
but is in its closure in the extended real numbers and the function can
be extended by continuity, the result is the obtained limit.
Examples: <code class="code">mpfr_hypot</code> on (+Inf,0) gives +Inf. But
<code class="code">mpfr_pow</code> cannot be defined on (1,+Inf) using this rule, as
one can find sequences (<var class="var">x</var>_<var class="var">n</var>,<var class="var">y</var>_<var class="var">n</var>)
such that <var class="var">x</var>_<var class="var">n</var> goes to 1, <var class="var">y</var>_<var class="var">n</var> goes
to +Inf and <var class="var">x</var>_<var class="var">n</var> to the <var class="var">y</var>_<var class="var">n</var>
goes to any positive value when <var class="var">n</var> goes to the infinity.
</p>
<p>When the input point is in the closure of the domain of the mathematical
function and an input argument is +0 (resp. &minus;0), one considers
the limit when the corresponding argument approaches 0 from above
(resp. below), if possible. If the limit is not defined (e.g.,
<code class="code">mpfr_sqrt</code> and <code class="code">mpfr_log</code> on &minus;0), the behavior is
specified in the description of the MPFR function, but must be consistent
with the rule from the above paragraph (e.g., <code class="code">mpfr_log</code> on ±0
gives &minus;Inf).
</p>
<p>When the result is equal to 0, its sign is determined by considering the
limit as if the input point were not in the domain: If one approaches 0
from above (resp. below), the result is +0 (resp. &minus;0);
for example, <code class="code">mpfr_sin</code> on &minus;0 gives &minus;0 and
<code class="code">mpfr_acos</code> on 1 gives +0 (in all rounding modes).
In the other cases, the sign is specified in the description of the MPFR
function; for example <code class="code">mpfr_max</code> on &minus;0 and +0 gives +0.
</p>
<p>When the input point is not in the closure of the domain of the function,
the result is NaN. Example: <code class="code">mpfr_sqrt</code> on &minus;17 gives NaN.
</p>
<p>When an input argument is NaN, the result is NaN, possibly except when
a partial function is constant on the finite floating-point numbers;
such a case is always explicitly specified in <a class="ref" href="constant.MPFR_Interface.html#MPFR-Interface">MPFR Interface</a>.
Example: <code class="code">mpfr_hypot</code> on (NaN,0) gives NaN, but <code class="code">mpfr_hypot</code>
on (NaN,+Inf) gives +Inf (as specified in
<a class="ref" href="constant.MPFR_Interface.html#Transcendental-Functions">Transcendental Functions</a>), since for any finite or infinite
input <var class="var">x</var>, <code class="code">mpfr_hypot</code> on (<var class="var">x</var>,+Inf) gives +Inf.
</p>
<p>MPFR also tries to follow the specifications of the IEEE&nbsp;754 standard

Any difference with IEEE&nbsp;754 that is not explicitly mentioned, other
than those due to the single NaN, is unintended and might be regarded as a
bug. See also <a class="ref" href="constant.MPFR_and_the_IEEE_754_Standard.html#start">MPFR and the IEEE 754 Standard</a>.

<h3 class="section" id="Exceptions-1">4.6 Exceptions</h3>
<p>MPFR defines a global (or per-thread) flag for each supported exception.
A macro evaluating to a power of two is associated with each flag and
exception, in order to be able to specify a group of flags (or a mask)
by OR&rsquo;ing such macros.
</p>
<p>Flags can be cleared (lowered), set (raised), and tested by functions
described in <a class="ref" href="constant.MPFR_Interface.html#Exception-Related-Functions">Exception Related Functions</a>.
</p>
<p>The supported exceptions are listed below. The macro associated with
each exception is in parentheses.
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Underflow (<code class="code">MPFR_FLAGS_UNDERFLOW</code>):
An underflow occurs when the exact result of a function is a non-zero
real number and the result obtained after the rounding, assuming an
unbounded exponent range (for the rounding), has an exponent smaller
than the minimum value of the current exponent range. (In the round-to-nearest
mode, the halfway case is rounded toward zero.)
<p>Note: This is not the single possible definition of the underflow. MPFR chooses
to consider the underflow <em class="emph">after</em> rounding. The underflow before rounding
can also be defined. For instance, consider a function that has the
exact result 7 multiplied by two to the power
<var class="var">e</var>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;4<!-- /@w -->, where <var class="var">e</var> is the smallest exponent
(for a significand between 1/2 and 1),
with a 2-bit target precision and rounding toward positive infinity.
The exact result has the exponent <var class="var">e</var>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1<!-- /@w -->. With the
underflow before rounding, such a function call would yield an underflow, as
<var class="var">e</var>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1<!-- /@w --> is outside the current exponent range. However, MPFR
first considers the rounded result assuming an unbounded exponent range.
The exact result cannot be represented exactly in precision 2, and here,
it is rounded to 0.5 times 2 to <var class="var">e</var>, which is
representable in the current exponent range. As a consequence, this will
not yield an underflow in MPFR.
</p>
</li><li>Overflow (<code class="code">MPFR_FLAGS_OVERFLOW</code>):
An overflow occurs when the exact result of a function is a non-zero
real number and the result obtained after the rounding, assuming an
unbounded exponent range (for the rounding), has an exponent larger
than the maximum value of the current exponent range. In the round-to-nearest
mode, the result is infinite.
Note: unlike the underflow case, there is only one possible definition of
overflow here.
</li><li>Divide-by-zero (<code class="code">MPFR_FLAGS_DIVBY0</code>):
An exact infinite result is obtained from finite inputs.
</li><li>NaN (<code class="code">MPFR_FLAGS_NAN</code>):
A NaN exception occurs when the result of a function is NaN.
</li><li>Inexact (<code class="code">MPFR_FLAGS_INEXACT</code>):
An inexact exception occurs when the result of a function cannot be
represented exactly and must be rounded.
</li><li>Range error (<code class="code">MPFR_FLAGS_ERANGE</code>):
A range exception occurs when a function that does not return a MPFR
number (such as comparisons and conversions to an integer) has an
invalid result (e.g., an argument is NaN in <code class="code">mpfr_cmp</code>, or a
conversion to an integer cannot be represented in the target type).
</li></ul>
<p>Moreover, the group consisting of all the flags is represented by
the <code class="code">MPFR_FLAGS_ALL</code> macro (if new flags are added in future
MPFR versions, they will be added to this macro too).
</p>
<p>Differences with the ISO C99 standard:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>In C, only quiet NaNs are specified, and a NaN propagation does not
raise an invalid exception. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, MPFR sets
the NaN flag whenever a NaN is generated, even when a NaN is propagated
(e.g., in NaN + NaN), as if all NaNs were signaling.
</li><li>An invalid exception in C corresponds to either a NaN exception or
a range error in MPFR.
</li></ul>

<h3 class="section" id="Memory-Handling-1">4.7 Memory Handling</h3>
<p>MPFR functions may create caches, e.g., when computing constants such
as Pi, either because the user has called a function like
<code class="code">mpfr_const_pi</code> directly or because such a function was called
internally by the MPFR library itself to compute some other function.
When more precision is needed, the value is automatically recomputed;
a minimum of 10% increase of the precision is guaranteed to avoid too
many recomputations.
</p>
<p>MPFR functions may also create thread-local pools for internal use
to avoid the cost of memory allocation. The pools can be freed with
<code class="code">mpfr_free_pool</code> (but with a default MPFR build, they should not
take much memory, as the allocation size is limited).
</p>
<p>At any time, the user can free various caches and pools with
<code class="code">mpfr_free_cache</code> and <code class="code">mpfr_free_cache2</code>. It is strongly advised
to free thread-local caches before terminating a thread, and all caches
before exiting when using tools like &lsquo;<samp class="samp">valgrind</samp>&rsquo; (to avoid memory leaks
being reported).
</p>
<p>MPFR allocates its memory either on the stack (for temporary memory only)
or with the same allocator as the one configured for GMP:
see Section &ldquo;Custom Allocation&rdquo; in <cite class="cite">GNU MP</cite>.
This means that the application must make sure that data allocated with the
current allocator will not be reallocated or freed with a new allocator.
So, in practice, if an application needs to change the allocator with
<code class="code">mp_set_memory_functions</code>, it should first free all data allocated
with the current allocator: for its own data, with <code class="code">mpfr_clear</code>,
etc.; for the caches and pools, with <code class="code">mpfr_mp_memory_cleanup</code> in
all threads where MPFR is potentially used. This function is currently
equivalent to <code class="code">mpfr_free_cache</code>, but <code class="code">mpfr_mp_memory_cleanup</code>
is the recommended way in case the allocation method changes in the future
(for instance, one may choose to allocate the caches for floating-point
constants with <code class="code">malloc</code> to avoid freeing them if the allocator
changes). Developers should also be aware that MPFR may also be used
indirectly by libraries, so that libraries based on MPFR should provide
a clean-up function calling <code class="code">mpfr_mp_memory_cleanup</code> and/or warn
their users about this issue.
</p>
<p>Note: For multithreaded applications, the allocator must be valid in
all threads where MPFR may be used; data allocated in one thread may
be reallocated and/or freed in some other thread.
</p>
<p>MPFR internal data such as flags, the exponent range, the default precision,
and the default rounding mode are either global (if MPFR has not been
compiled as thread safe) or per-thread (thread-local storage, TLS).
The initial values of TLS data after a thread is created entirely
depend on the compiler and thread implementation (MPFR simply does
a conventional variable initialization, the variables being declared
with an implementation-defined TLS specifier).
</p>
<p>Writers of libraries using MPFR should be aware that the application and/or
another library used by the application may also use MPFR, so that changing
the exponent range, the default precision, or the default rounding mode may
have an effect on this other use of MPFR since these data are not duplicated
(unless they are in a different thread). Therefore any such value changed in
a library function should be restored before the function returns (unless
the purpose of the function is to do such a change). Writers of software
using MPFR should also be careful when changing such a value if they use
a library using MPFR (directly or indirectly), in order to make sure that
such a change is compatible with the library.

<h3 class="section" id="Getting-the-Best-Efficiency-Out-of-MPFR-1">4.8 Getting the Best Efficiency Out of MPFR</h3>
<p>Here are a few hints to get the best efficiency out of MPFR:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>you should avoid allocating and clearing variables. Reuse variables
      whenever possible, allocate or clear outside of loops, pass
      temporary variables to subroutines instead of allocating them inside
      the subroutines;
</li><li>use <code class="code">mpfr_swap</code> instead of <code class="code">mpfr_set</code> whenever possible.
      This will avoid copying the significands;
</li><li>avoid using MPFR from C++, or make sure your C++ interface does not
      perform unnecessary allocations or copies. Slowdowns of up to a
      factor 15 have been observed on some applications with a C++ interface;
</li><li>MPFR functions work in-place: to compute <code class="code">a = a + b</code> you don&rsquo;t
      need an auxiliary variable, you can directly write
      <code class="code">mpfr_add (a, a, b, ...)</code>.
