# Iced - Additional Widgets

This crate contains additional widgets for the GUI library [Iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced).

Every widget is hidden by a feature gate. This allows you to cherry pick the widgets you actually need.

## Usage:

Include `iced_aw` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
iced = "0.4.2"
iced_aw = { version = "0.2.0", default-features = false, features = [...] }
```

**Why not Crates.io?**

This crate is currently based on top of the master branch of Iced. Crates.io [refuses](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories) crates that uses git repositories as their dependencies. Once Iced becomes stable, `iced_aw` will be published on Crates.io as well.

## Quickstart features

Quickstart features are pretty handy to start and experiment having everything like colors or icons available. Nevertheless, it is recommended to disable these features once the GUI is ready for production and to only include the things you really need.

### Color palette

This crate adds a predefined color palette based on the [CSS color palette](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp).

Enable colors with the feature `colors`.

### Bootstrap icons

Thanks to [Bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com), iced_aw now contains ~1,200 icons to be used in an Iced GUI.

Enable icons with the feature `icons`.

*Note: the icon font with ~1,200 weights around 0.274 MB. This features should only be used for experimenting with all the icons.*
